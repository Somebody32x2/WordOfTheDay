## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `bun install`, start a development server:

```sh
bun dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
bun build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun preview`.
